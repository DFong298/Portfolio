# parallax-web-portfolio
Web portfolio made that was intended to implement a parallax scrolling effect, made using pure HTML/CSS, with usage of JavaScript later on.

Parallax idea was scrapped in order to make the website mobile friendly, and compatible with all devices.

Website is a constant work in progress. Intended additions include snowflake effects, and hover effect animations.
